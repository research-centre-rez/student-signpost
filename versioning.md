For all projects it is required to have repository under [research-centre-rez](https://github.com/research-centre-rez) organization. 

Name of the repository should be as short as possible but relevant to its content. Inspiration can be taken from [existing repositories](https://github.com/orgs/research-centre-rez/repositories).

TODO: unify naming convention between repos ... e.g.: underscore vs. hyphen, uppercase/lowercase usage, snake_case vs. CamelCase, prefixes, suffixes...
